Software TODO:

1. Making angle consistent:
 - Pigeon2: CCW
 - CANCoder: CCW
 - PID: CCW
 - Xbox: CCW

2. Make square test work: check PID convergences step-by-step.

3. Orange disk contour recognition. Detect nearest/largest note in view, drive so facing center of contour.

4. AprilTag alignment, make robot parallel to detected april tag (drive Field pose to parallel pose)
    - Limelight pipeline sends position in field or robot space

5. Path planning
